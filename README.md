## Using Records module
### Adding records:
```
#  Create a dictionary of your data.
link_Records = {
    "youtube": "https://youtube.com",
    "facebook": "https://facebook.com"
    }

#  Pass the dictionary to the function to save and the topic/table name
await self.records.add(topic="Links", records=link_Records)
```

### Getting records:
```
#  Getting one record
#  Pass the topic/table name and record key.
youtube_Link_Record = self.records.get(topic="Links", record_Key="youtube")

#  Getting all records about a topic
#  Pass the topic/table name.
all_Link_Records = self.records.get(topic="Links")
```

### Removing records:
```
#  Removing link youtube from the Links topic.
await self.records.remove(topic="Links", record_Key="youtube")

```
